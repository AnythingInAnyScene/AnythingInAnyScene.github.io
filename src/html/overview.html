            <p><b >Overview of proposed Anything in Any Scene framework for photorealistic video object insertion.</b> 
                The scene video and mesh object bank module supplies diverse dynamic scene videos and objects for video composition.
                The object placement and stabilization module ensures that the inserted object is stably anchored across continuous video frames.
                The lighting estimation and shadow generation module addresses the challenge of creating realistic lighting and shadow effects during the rendering process. 
                Lastly, the photorealistic style transfer module enhance the photorealism of the resulting simulated video frames by correcting unrealistic artifacts that differ from real-world captured videos, such as imaging quality discrepancies in noise level, color fidelity, and sharpness.
